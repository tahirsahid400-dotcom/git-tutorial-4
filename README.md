The purpose of this repository is to:

● Collaborate with others using GitHub.
● Create, commit, push, and merge changes using branches and pull requests.
● Demonstrate proof of work via GitHub and documentation.

The steps taken to complete this repository are as follows:
Step 1 - Install Git on your local machine and create a GitHub account (if you do not already 
have one).  
Step 2 - Create a local Git repository on your computer. 
Step 3 - Choose one classmate (you may find a collaborator during the tutorial or before) and 
add them as a Collaborator on your GitHub repository. 
Step 4 - Create a new branch in your repository. 
Step 5 - Add a new file to your repository (for example, a text file or Python file, which prints 
your first and last names). 
Step 6 - Commit the new file with a clear message (e.g., “Added sample file for tutorial”). 
Step 7- Push the new branch to GitHub. 
Step 8 - Create a Pull Request (PR) and assign your collaborator as the Reviewer. 
Step 9 - Wait for your collaborator to review and approve your PR. 
Step 10: Once approved, merge the new branch into the main (master) branch.
